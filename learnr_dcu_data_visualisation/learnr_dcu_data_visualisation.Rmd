## Introduction

Visualising data is one of the most important tasks facing the data analyst. It’s important for two distinct but closely related reasons. Firstly, there’s the matter of drawing “presentation graphics”: displaying your data in a clean, visually appealing fashion makes it easier for your reader to understand what you’re trying to tell them. Equally important, perhaps even more important, is the fact that drawing graphs helps you to understand the data. To that end, it’s important to draw “exploratory graphics” that help you learn about the data as you go about analysing it. These points might seem pretty obvious, but I cannot count the number of times I’ve seen people forget them.

We’ll use the {ggplot2} package, as it provides an easy way to customize your plots. {ggplot2} is rooted in the data visualization theory known as the grammar of graphics (Wilkinson 2005).

As a part of the {tidyverse} package, {ggplot2} is loaded when {tidyverse} is loaded as well:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

<!--
```{r ggplot-demo, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars) + 
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, 
             alpha = .8,
             size = 5,
             color = "white") +
  aes(fill = dist) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "magma", end = .7) +
  labs(title = "That cars data again!") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "grey95")) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
flipbookr::chunk_gif_flipbook_embed(
  chunk_name = "ggplot-demo",
  title = "Side-by-side co-evolution!"
) 
```
-->

### The gapminder dataset

In February 2006, a Swedish physician and data advocate named Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled “The best stats you’ve ever seen” where he presented global economic, health, and development data from the website [](www.gapminder.org) . 
For this tutorial, are going to use a dataset from this website. The dataset is read with the function `read_csv()` from the {readr} package into an object called `gapminder`.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
gapminder <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder.csv' %>% 
  readr::read_csv()
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  head()
```

Each row in this table corresponds to a country at a specific year. For each row, we have 6 columns:

- **country**: Name of country.
- **year**: Year of the observation (between 1952 and 2007).
- **pop**: Number of people living in the country.
- **continent**: Which of the five continents the country is part of. Note that “Americas” includes countries in both North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded.
- **lifeExp**: Life expectancy in years.
- **gdpPercap**: Gross domestic product (in US dollars).

## Chapter 1: The grammar of graphics

Each language has a grammar consisting of types of words and the rules with which to string them together into sentences. If a sentence is grammatically correct, we’re able to parse it, even though that doesn’t ensure that it’s interesting, beautiful, or even meaningful.

Similarly, plots can be divided up into their core components, which come together via a set of rules.

**“the grammar of graphics”** (the “gg” in ggplot) defines a set of rules for constructing statistical graphics by combining different types of layers. 

Some of the major components are :

- Data
- Geometries
- Mapping
- Themes

### Data

The **data** are the actual variables we’re plotting, which we pass to ggplot through the data argument. As you’ve learned, ggplot takes a dataframe in which each column is a variable.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe)
```

**In a similar perspective as the pipe operator does, layers in {ggplot2} are added with the symbole `+`.**

### Geometries

**Geometries**, which are shapes we use to represent our data. There are a dedicated function for every type of shape to plot but all start with `geom_`

|function          |shape    |
|------------------|---------|
|`geom_point()`    |point    |
|`geom_line()`     |line     |
|`geom_bar()`      |bar      |
|`geom_histogram()`|histogram|
|`geom_boxplot()`  |boxplot  |
|...               |...      |

The list is very long but here are the main ones. Multiple **geometries** can be added as layers by using the same `+` symbole. 

*Example for scatterplots:*

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  geom_point() 
```

*Example for line graph:*

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  geom_line() 
```

*Example for bar graph:*

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  geom_bar() 
```

By default **geometries** inherit their mapping from the frame aesthetics (the ones in the `ggplot()` function). However it is possible to define specific aesthetics for each layers for more customisation.

### Aesthetic mapping

The **aesthetic mapping** refers to the frame of the plot, `x` for the variable in the x-axis and `y` for the variable in the y-axis. There are many more aesthetics such as `color`, `fill` and `group` but let's focus on the x and y axises for the moment. The mapping is performed by a function in {ggplot2} called `aes()` for aesthetics. 

This is an essential concept to remember, the mapping of a plot (frame axises) is built from aesthetics.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = my_xaxis_variable, y = my_yaxis_variable))
```

But for the moment let's add a `geom_point()` layer with some mapping. Create a plot frame by using the `ggplot()` with the data argument as `gapminder` object and a `geom_point()` layer with in the mapping argument (`aes()` function) inclunding `gdpPercap` as x and `lifeExp` as y:

```{r exercise1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = ___) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = ___, y = ___))

```

Because `gapminder` is an object name it doesn't need quotation mark. Also, because we are still in the tidyverse with {ggplot2}, the name of the columns used for x and y (`gdpPercap` and `lifeExp`) don't need quotation mark neither.

Again, the arguments names of the `ggplot()` function and layers can be omitted if filled in the right order:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(my_dataframe) +
  geom_point(aes(my_xaxis_variable, my_yaxis_variable))
```

Obviously, some type of layer are not suitable for every aesthetics, it depends on how many variables are included and their type (categorical or continuous). 

Try using `geom_line()`, `geom_bar()` and `geom_boxplot()` with the current ggplot frame `aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)`:

```{r exercise3, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_line()
  

```

```{r exercise5, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_bar()
  

```

```{r exercise6, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_boxplot()
  

```

Aesthetic mapping represents not only the variables defined as x-axis and y-axis but also, colors of borders (colors), colors of shapes (fill), shapes ...

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = my_dataframe) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(
    x = my_xaxis_variable, 
    y = my_yaxis_variable,
    color = my_color_variable,
    fill = my_fill_variable,
    shape = my_shape_variable,
    size = my_size_variable
  )
)
```

Try to run the following code which is adding not only a x- and y-axis to a scatterplot, but also colors to the points:

```{r exercise2, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent))

```

Instead of using `continent` variable as color mapping, use `continent` variable as shape mapping:

```{r exercise7, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, ... = continent))

```

We’ll go over other aspects of the grammar of graphics (such as facets, statistics, and coordinates) as they come up. Let’s start visualizing some data by first choosing a theme, which describes all of the non-data ink in our plot, like grid lines and text.

### Themes

Now, to make the plot more professional, let's remove that standard gray background using a different theme. Many themes come built into the ggplot2 package. My preference is `theme_bw()` but once you start typing `theme_` a list of options will pop up.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  theme_bw()

```

Built-in ggplot2 themes includes `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_minimal()`, `theme_dark()`, `theme_light()`, ... Try to add a different theme in order to see the difference:

```{r exercise4, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent))

```

### Exercises

1. Build a ggplot with the `gapminder` dataset and one `geom_boxplot()` layer which contains the x as `continent`, y as `lifeExp` and color as `continent` in its `aes()`. Use a theme of your choice as well:

```{r exercise8, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise8-solution}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

2. Build a ggplot with the `gapminder` dataset and one `geom_col()` layer which contains the x as `year`, y as `pop` and fill as `continent` in its `aes()`. Use a theme of your choice as well:

```{r exercise9, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise9-solution}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_col(aes(x = year, y = pop, fill = continent)) +
  theme_dark()
```

## Chapter 2: Customizing plots

Take a look at the ggplot2 [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf), and think of ways you could improve the plot.

### Facets

Before continuing with the next customization layers, let’s briefly introduce a new concept called faceting. Faceting is used when we’d like to split a particular visualization by the values of another variable. This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, but whose content will differ.

For example, suppose we were interested in looking at the evolution of life expectency by continent from 1952. We could “split” this figure for each continent. In other words, we would plot a scatterplot for each continent separately. We do this by adding `facet_wrap(~ continent)` layer. Note the ~ is a “tilde” and can generally be found on the key next to the “1” key on US keyboards. The tilde is required and you’ll receive the error `Error in as.quoted(facets) : object 'continent' not found` if you don’t include it here.

```{r exercise10, exercise=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent) +
  theme_classic()
```

We can also specify the number of rows and columns in the grid by using the `nrow` and `ncol` arguments inside of `facet_wrap()`. For example, say we would like our faceted figure to have 1 rows instead of 2. We simply add an `nrow = 1` argument to `facet_wrap(~ continent)`:

```{r exercise11, exercise=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  theme_classic()
```

### Labels (easy way)

Now, let’s capitalize the x and y axis labels and add a main title to the figure. Ggplot has a layer called `labs()` in order to change the name of the axis labels very quickly. `labs()` has at least 3 arguments for us: x, y and title.

```{r exercise12, exercise=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Year (from 1952 to 2007)",
    y = "Life Expectancy",
    title = "Evolution of life expectancy from 1952 to 2007 per continent."
  ) +
  theme_classic()
```

### Labels (hard way) and aesthetics customisation

The `labs()` layer is very helpful for a quick change but if you need more customisation you can use the `scale_` family of layers.

The `scale_` family of layers controls not only the label of an aesthetic but also the marks and ticks and many more details. To control these details you have to use the right `scale_` layer by calling `scale_[aesthetic argument]_[type of variable]`. Example in our previous plot:
- to change the `year` label, use `scale_x_continuous()` layer
- to change the `lifeExp` label, use `scale_y_continuous()` layer

```{r exercise13, exercise=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous("Year (from 1952 to 2007)") +
  scale_y_continuous("Life Expectancy") +
  theme_classic()
```

As you can see the writing of the x-axis ticks are overlapping, which is not very neat. To change that we can decrease the resolution of the ticks from every 10 years to every 25 years with the `breaks` argument in the `scale_` family of layers:

```{r exercise14, exercise=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous("Year (from 1952 to 2007)", breaks = c(1950, 1975, 2000)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Life Expectancy") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Statistics and special effects

Instead of creating summaries inside the dataframe object, ggplot has some function to calculate and display them automatically. One can say that they are for lazy people but they are so useful!

The first special effect is the `geom_smooth()` layer. `geom_smooth()` is a classic geometry layer but which displays linear and non-linear trends.

```{r exercise15, exercise=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous("Year (from 1952 to 2007)", breaks = c(1950, 1975, 2000)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Life Expectancy") +
  theme_classic()
```

`geom_smooth()` has one important extra argument called `method`. If method has the value "lm", a linear regression will be shown. If method has the value "loess" or "gam", a non-linear regression will be shown.

```{r exercise16, exercise=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent), method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous("Year (from 1952 to 2007)", breaks = c(1950, 1975, 2000)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Life Expectancy") +
  theme_classic()
```

The second very useful layer is `stat_summary()` but it will not be introduced here to leave you digest all these informations.

### Inherit proriety of geometries

You can add as many geometry layers as you want, however repeating the mapping for each geometry layers is very redundent. Thankfully, if all your geometry layers are using the same aesthetics mapping, it is possible to include this mapping inside the `ggplot()`, then all the geometry layers will have the same mapping:

```{r exercise17, exercise=TRUE, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous("Year (from 1952 to 2007)", breaks = c(1950, 1975, 2000)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Life Expectancy") +
  theme_classic()
```

### Exercises

1. Build a ggplot with the `gapminder` dataset and one `geom_boxplot()` layer which contains the x as `continent`, y as `lifeExp` and color as `continent` in its `aes()`. Use `year` as a facet variable, use a theme of your choice as well and changes axises labels:

```{r exercise18, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise18-solution}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  scale_x_discrete("", breaks = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous("Life Expectancy") +
  scale_color_discrete("Continent") +
  theme_minimal()
```

2. Build a ggplot with the `gapminder` dataset and:
- one `geom_line()` layer which contains the x as `year`, y as `lifeExp` and group as `country` in its `aes()`
- one `geom_smooth()` layer which contains the x as `year`, y as `lifeExp` and color as `continent` in its `aes()`
- one `facet_wrap()` for each continent

Also change the labels of the axises and use a theme of your choice as well:

```{r exercise19, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise19-solution, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = country)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~continent, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous("Year (from 1952 to 2007)", breaks = c(1950, 1975, 2000)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Life Expectancy") +
  scale_color_discrete("Continent") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Chapter 3: Include ggplot in pipes

A very powerfull way to create figures in R is to use a ggplot at the end of a data transformation pipe.

Indeed, having a dataframe object as first arugment of the `ggplot()` function is similar as using a pipe operator and to chain it to the `ggplot()` function:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# this classic representation:
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point()

# is the same as:
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note: the layer are still added with the `+` symbole.

In this last code, nothing prevent use to modify the dataframe using `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `summarise()`.

### Filter to ggplot()

You can easily diplay only the data for a specific section of you interest. For example, let's filter the data only for Ireland:

```{r exercise20, exercise=TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Ireland") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

In the same what it is possible to include more than one filter:

```{r exercise21, exercise=TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Ireland" | country == "France") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

`select()` is not that usefull for `ggplot()` so it will not be presented here but it can alway be included in the pipe chaine if required.

### Mutate to ggplot()

If you need to display a variable that has to be created beforehand, you can always include a mutate statement in the chain.

For example, let's create the variable `gdpPercountry` which is the result of the multiplcation between countries' population and countries' gdpPercap. Then let's display this information for Ireland and France:

```{r exercise22, exercise=TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdpPercountry = gdpPercap*pop) %>% 
  filter(country == "Ireland" | country == "France") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercountry, lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line()
```

### Summary to ggplot()

Finally, one of the most usefull possibility will be to summarise variables per groups and to display these informations in figures.

For example, let's create the average population per continent and display how this average evolve with the time:

```{r exercise23, exercise=TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year, continent) %>% 
  summarise(m_pop = mean(pop)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, m_pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_line()
```

We can also compare the sum of the population by continent for the year 2007:

```{r exercise24, exercise=TRUE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(s_pop = sum(pop)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent, s_pop, fill = continent)) +
  geom_col()
```

### Exercises

1. Display the evolution of the average life expectancy by continent according the time.

```{r exercise25, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise25-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year, continent) %>% 
  summarise(m_exp = mean(lifeExp)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year, m_exp, color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous("Average life expectancy (year)") +
  scale_x_continuous("") +
  scale_fill_discrete("Continent") +
  theme_bw()
```

2. Display the relationship between gdpPercap and lifeExp for each year from 2000 and only for european countries

```{r exercise26, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r exercise26-solution}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe" & year >= 2000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, color = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous("Life expectancy (year)") +
  scale_x_continuous("GDP per Capita") +
  scale_color_discrete("") +
  facet_wrap(~year)
```
